# Feeding Frenzy Clone (MOSTLY COMPLETE)
A little Feeding Frenzy clone I made with other students in my first programming course at university using Processing. Incredibly simplistic. Certainly not as DEEP (pun intended) as the original Feeding Frenzy, but functional to kill a few minutes of time if you're really bored.

## To-do list
* Add reasonable progression to player
  * Should player be able to eat all fish at and/or below their level?
* Fix bug where difficulty restarts after losing in 'HARD' difficulty
